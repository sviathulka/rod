## [Documentation](https://go-rod.github.io/) | [API reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sviathulka/rod?tab=doc) | [FAQ](https://go-rod.github.io/#/faq/README)

Rod is a high-level driver directly based on [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol).
It's designed for web automation and scraping for both high-level and low-level use, senior developers can use the low-level packages and functions to easily
customize or build up their own version of Rod, the high-level functions are just examples to build a default version of Rod.
